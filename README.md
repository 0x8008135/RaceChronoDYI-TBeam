# RaceChronoDYI-TBeam

Flash the Arduino sketch in `rc_dyi_tbeam/rc_dyi_tbeam.ino` to the `TTGO T-Beam ESP32 NEO-M8N` device.

Pair the device with your mobile phone running the RaceChrono App (blue led should blink differently when paired)

Enjoy!

# Troubleshooting
In case of issues, it is possible to use the `passthrough.ino` to interface the u-center program with the ublox chipset.

Suggested/Tested antennas:
- 712-ANT-GPS-SH2-SMA (Mouser)
- FXUB63 (TAOGlass)

Any PRs or issues are welcome
